# PHP-backdoors
A collection of PHP backdoors. For educational and/or testing purposes only.
Notes

    The deobfuscated folder does not necessarily contain deobfuscated versions of the backdoors you can find in the obfuscated folder . To deobfuscate those and other tricks, Check out the [PHP tools](PHP tools.md) section.
    Always investigate malware in a secure environment. This means: separately from your network and in a virtual machine!
    Some backdoors may be backdoored (yes, really). Don't ever use this for any malicious purposes.
